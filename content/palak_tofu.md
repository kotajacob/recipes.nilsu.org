## Equipment:
 * Cutting tools
 * Pot
 * Immersion blender (stick blender) (if you don't have one, a regular blender would work too; it would be less convenient though)

## Ingredients:
 * Some oil
 * 1 medium to large onion
---
 * 1 pound of spinach
 * 1 cup crushed tomato (any tomato product would work, but be careful if you use sauce, since it often already has spices in it)
---
 * Lots of garlic powder (you can use fresh, but I did not)
 * Plenty of ginger powder (same as garlic; fresh is fine)
 * Plenty of garam masala
 * Some cumin
 * Some turmeric
 * Some chili flakes (cayenne is fine to)
 * Salt to taste
---
 * 1 pound of tofu

## Instructions:
1. Dice the onion
1. Put some oil in a pot large enough to fit all the ingredients
1. Put the pot over medium-high heat and add the onion
1. As you let the onion cook through, cut the tofu into cubes
1. Once the onion is cooked, add the spinach and tomato
1. Let the spinach wilt, and then blend the whole mixture until smooth
1. Add the tofu cubes and wait until they cook through
1. Eat over rice
