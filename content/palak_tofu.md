draft: false
cuisines:
  - Indian
courses:
  - Entre
equipment:
  - Cutting tools
  - Pot
  - Immersion blender (stick blender) (if you don't have one, a regular blender would work too; it would be less convenient though)
ingredients:
  - Some oil
  - 1 medium to large onion
  - break
  - 1 pound of spinach
  - 1 cup crushed tomato (any tomato product would work, but be careful if you use sauce, since it often already has spices in it)
  - break
  - Lots of garlic powder (you can use fresh, but I did not)
  - Plenty of ginger powder (same as garlic; fresh is fine)
  - Plenty of garam masala
  - Some cumin
  - Some turmeric
  - Some chili flakes (cayenne is fine to)
  - Salt to taste
  - break
  - 1 pound of tofu
instructions:
  - Dice the onion
  - Put some oil in a pot large enough to fit all the ingredients
  - Put the pot over medium-high heat and add the onion
  - As you let the onion cook through, cut the tofu into cubes
  - Once the onion is cooked, add the spinach and tomato
  - Let the spinach wilt, and then blend the whole mixture until smooth
  - Add the tofu cubes and wait until they cook through
  - Eat over rice
