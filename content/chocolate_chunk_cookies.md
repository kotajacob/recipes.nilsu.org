  - Add the peanut butter and continue mixing for about 5 minutes
  - Add in the spices, baking powder, and baking soda

  - The dough should not be crumbly as all, but slightly oily and easy to form
  - Separate into 18-22 balls onto an oven tray
  - Bake for 15 mins at 180c, then lightly press them down with a spoon (don't
    flatten, just give them a vaguely cookie shape), and cook for 2 more minutes
